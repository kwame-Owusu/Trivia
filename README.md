# Trivia

simple GUI program using the open trivia api to get some questions and answer them, true of false style. 
its fun because there is also an interactive component of sound, which will make the user know if they are correct or not
it was fun creating this program, cuz i learned about api's  and how to set parameters for the api and also refresh my mind on OOP.
the type of questions and length of the question can all be manipulated using the parameters, and looking at the api guide of opentrivia
